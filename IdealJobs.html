							<h2>Ideal Jobs Discussion</h2>
							<p>As can be seen in the comparison table above, our ideal jobs share some similarities, but also differences. With Owen, Zach and Mun Kit’s ideal careers all mainly tackling management and maintenance of software and hardware, these three jobs all relate to each other. Mun Kit’s Support Technician job deals with the maintenance side of I.T, as the job title suggests. Owen and Zach’s ideal jobs on the other hand relate more so the engineering aspect of creating networking systems and infrastructure. Aidyn and Harrison’s ideal jobs focus on a different aspect of the I.T industry, databases and datasets. With their ideal jobs being Data Analyst and Data Administrator, it is obvious that similarities will be present in these jobs. Both deal with interpreting datasets, and also how to deconstruct them into something meaningful. However, Aidyn’s Data Analyst ideal job interprets datasets with the use of improving and developing products for the company of Reecetech. On the other hand, Harrison’s Data Admin job interprets datasets with the purpose of aiding in research to advise clients on the data that they are collecting.</p> 
                                                        <p>The wildcard ideal job here is Teodore’s, which is a Creative Director of a AAA video game publisher DICE. To dissect this role, similarities in jobs can be seen in the requirement to have good teamwork and team leadership skills which is of course imperative as a successful creative director. Mun Kit and Owen’s ideal jobs also require good team work skills to fulfill their roles. Zach and Teodore’s roles also require good ability in documentation and time management. In contrast, Teodore’s ideal job requires not just 8+ years experience in the video game industry, but also fantastic public speaking abilities to represent the video game studio.</p>
                                                        <p>Overall, it is apparent that these ideal job roles all share some similarities, but also many many differences. This is a testament to how vast the IT industry is, and how all of us want to follow different career avenues. </p>
